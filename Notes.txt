--> What is Node ?
We could run JS in web browser & Node is a JS runtime that execute code outside the web browser 

--> What is Node used for ?
Web Server 
Video Games 
Drone software 


--> What is Process in Node js ?
The process module in Node.js allows us to get information related to the node and control its behavior. This module is globally available, and we can use it to get information such as process ID, version, release, CPU usage, and uptime or perform actions such as killing processes, setting uid, setting groups, unmasking, etc.

--> File System module
We use file system module to do various operation on file such as craete , remove , add etc.



                <-- EXPRESS -->
Express is a framework which is help us
-> start up a server to listen for requests 
-> parse incoming requests
-> match those requests to particular routes
-> Craft out http & associated content.

some important functions -->
listen --> for start or listen to the server
use  -->  method mounts or puts the specified middleware functions at the specified path. This middleware function will be executed only when the base of the requested path matches the defined path.
get -> for the get request.


GET & POST REQUEST -->

GET --> We use get for requesting resources, a page or retrieve any information. 
data sent by query string , Info. is plainly visible in the URL
limited amount of data we can sent.

POST --> Used to post data to the server , Used to write write / create / update
data sent by request body not string & can send any sort of data


WHAT IS REST ?
Its basically a set of guideline for how a client + server should communicate with each other and perform CRUD operation on given resource.


What is Method override ?
--> Lets you use HTTP verbs such as PUT or Delete in place where client doesn't support.


                                <-- DATABASE -->
-> A place where we store our data.
Type of Database -->
SQL -> Structured Query Language Database are relational database. we pre-define the schema of tables before we insert anything. i.e -> Postgres , MySQL
NO-SQL -->NO-SQL Does not use SQL. There are many types of NO sql database like key value and graph stores. --> Mongo , CouchDB , Neo4j

-> Collections: A container of similiar objects in database.
--> Mongo Shell Commands
    -> use DatabaseName (To Create DB)
    -> show databases/dbs (To Show Database)
    -> show collections
    -> db.collections_name.find(id) -> to see all objects or object in collections

-> Mongo store data in BSON (Binary JSON) format which is similiar to JSON. Faster than JSON. Stores in Binary of JSON format.

--> INSERTING MONGO

-> db.collections_name.insertOne() -> Single Document insert in Collection
-> db.collections_name.insertMany() -> Many Document insert in Collection
-> db.collections_name.insert() --> Single or Many Document in Collection

--> FINDING MONGO
-> db.collections.find({optional}) -> find one or more Document in collections
-> db.collections.findOne({optional}) -> find one Document in collections

--> UPDATE MONGO
-> db.collections.updateOne({$set:{age:5}})
    $set -> it is type of operator which is used to update value and it also added new parameter.
-> db.collections.updateMany({$set:{age:5}})    
-> db.collections.replace({$set:{age:5}})

--> DELETE MONGO

-> db.collections.deleteOne({parameter})
-> db.collections.deleteMany({parameter})

--> What is Mongoose ?
    -> Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB. MongoDB is a NoSQL database and Mongoose is used to interact with MongoDB by providing a schema-based solution. The Mongoose acts as the abstraction layer over the MongoDB database. It is generally preferred over using normal MongoDB because it simplifies the process of sending complex queries.


-> A Mongoose model is a wrapper of the Mongoose schema. A Mongoose schema defines the document's properties, default values, types of data, validators, etc. In contrast, a Mongoose model provides an interface for the database to create, query, update, delete records, and so on.


.save() --> to save your data or new instance in database.
.inserMany() -> insert many document.

.find({}).then(data=> console.log(data)) --> to find any data.
.updateOne({year : 1986},{year : 1984}}.then(m=> console.log(m))
.findOneAndUpdate({},{},{new:true}) --> it will find the data and updated but after execute it will give original data rather than update one so for that to solve problem we have to use optional object that is new which default value is false but we need to setup true.

.deleteOne({}) , .findOneAndDelete({}) --> To delete any data.


                    --Schema Validation-- 
Schema Types -->

name : 
{
    type : String , 
    required: true , 
    default : "Hello" , 
    minLength: [0,'Please write something'] , 
    maxLength : 100 , 
}
category : {
    type : [String],
    enum : ['Bike','Safety']
} , 
 qty : 
        {
            online : 
            {
                type : Number , 
                default : 0
            },
            offline : 
            {
                type : Number , 
                default : 0
            }
        }


Product.findOneAndUpdate({name:'BMW'},{price:-1245},{new:true , runValidators: true})
--> runValidators check the schema Validation at update time by default its value false 
but we have to changed.


--> Model Instance Methods

collections.method.function_name = function()
{
    
}

Mongoose Virtualsc -> They give us ability to add a propties to schema that don't actually exist in the database. 

personSchema.virtual('fullname').get(function()
{
    return `${this.first} ${this.last}`
}).set( function(v)
{
    this.first = v.substr(0, v.indexOf(' '));
    this.last = v.substr(v.indexOf(' ') + 1);
})


middleware -> Middleware (also called pre and post hooks) are functions which are passed control during execution of asynchronous functions. Middleware is specified on the schema level and is useful for writing plugins.
Why we use Next() -> If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

                        <-- What is Middleware -->
->  Middleware in Express. js is a function that is accessible to the request, response objects and the next middleware function. It can execute any code, terminate the request-response cycle, make needed changes in req and res objects, and detect errors. 

                <-- Error Handlers -->
The default error handler -> Express comes with a built-in error handler that takes care of any errors that might be encountered in the app. This default error-handling middleware function is added at the end of the middleware function stack.

Once we throw an error from a function no code would run which is present in the function after throwing the error

const verifyPassword = (req, res, next) => {
    const { password } = req.query;
    if (password === 'chickennugget') {
        next();
    }
    console.log("PEEP PEEP")
    throw new AppError('password requireddd', 401);
    console.log("APP IS GREAT") // This won't get printed
}
So, after throwing the error the control is passed to the error handling middleware, which is the below one in our case

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.log("******************************************")
    console.log("*****************ERROR*****************")
    console.log("******************************************")
    console.log(err)
    next(err)
})
Now, when we pass the error to the next function, the default express error handler is going to look at the Error Object (we have AppError but that inherits from Error), and then it extracts the message and status code it requires from the error object that we have passed, and sends it as a response.




                --> DATA RELATIONSHIPS WITH MONGO <--

ONE TO FEW -> Embed the data directly into the document e.g - one user have multiple addresses.

ONE TO MANY -> One option is to store your data separately , but then store reference to document ID's somewhere inside the parent.

ONE TO BAJILLIONS -> With thousands and more document , it's more efficient to store a 
reference to the parents on child document.

What is mongoose populate ?
The populate() method in Mongoose allows you to retrieve referenced documents and populate fields with their corresponding data.


               <-- Express Router -->

Instead we put all router in one application we can break it router into separate file and group them together thats why express Router is work.
A router object is an isolated instance of middleware and routes. You can think of it as a “mini-application,” capable only of performing middleware and routing functions. Every Express application has a built-in app router.
// invoked for any requests passed to this router
router.use(function (req, res, next) {
  // .. some logic here .. like any other middleware
  next()
})

// will handle any request that ends in /events
// depends on where the router is "use()'d"
router.get('/events', function (req, res, next) {
  // ..
})

// only requests to /calendar/* will be sent to our "router"
app.use('/calendar', router)


COOKIES --> 
A cookie (also known as a web cookie or browser cookie) is a small piece of data a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store cookies, create new cookies, modify existing ones, and send them back to the same server with later requests. Cookies enable web applications to store limited amounts of data and remember state information; by default the HTTP protocol is stateless.

Cookies can be accessed by the browser user, the site a user is on or by a third party that might use the information for different purposes. Common use cases for cookies include session management, personalization and tracking.


signed Cookie -> It make cookie value crypto through HMAC function.
//VERIFY COOKIE
app.get('/verifyCookie',(req,res)=>
{
    console.log(req.signedCookies);
    res.send(req.signedCookies);
});

//SIGNED COOKIE
app.get('/signedCookie',(req,res)=>
{
    res.cookie('fruit','grape',{signed : true});
    res.send('THIS IS SIGNED COOKIE PAGE');
});


SESSION -> It is not very practical or secure to store your lot of data client-side using cookies. This is where session comes in!
Session are server side data store that we use to make HTTP stateful. Instead of storing data using cookies, we store the data on server side and then send the browser a cookie that can  be used to retrieve data. 


flash -> When you do some action and after you want any message to flash once and disapear after that.


Note -> What is res.locals? The app.locals object has properties that are local variables within the application, and will be available in templates rendered with res.render.
